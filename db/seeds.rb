# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).

# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

I will listen and respond thoughtfully.  My approach is centered on you: what brought you to the office, your feelings, your conflicts, your relationships, your job, your background.  People know a great deal about themselves and I know you will convey your concerns in your own way.  Together we will move through a process focused on your issues."}])
