Home.create([{message: "I am an experienced, licensed clinical social worker and psychoanalyst.  In consultation, you will be invited 
	to make yourself as comfortable as possible and to speak freely.  I will listen and respond thoughtfully.  My approach is centered 
	on you: what brought you to the office, your feelings, your conflicts, your relationships, your job, your background.  People know 
	a great deal about themselves and I know you will convey your concerns in your own way.  Together we will move through a process 
	focused on your issues."}])

About.create([{message: "I am a licensed clinical social worker having graduated with an MSS and an MLSP from Bryn Mawr College, School of Social Work and Social Research in 1983 followed by post-masters training in adult psychoanalysis.  I am a Certified Psychoanalyst.  Prior to that time, I attained a Bachelor of Social Work degree from Arizona State University.  I am currently on the faculty of the Psychoanalytic Center of Philadelphia and teach in the Adult Psychotherapy Program.

	<h2> My Areas of Focus </h2>
	Anxiety and Depression</br>
	Relationship Issues</br>
	Conflicts at home, school, or work</br>
	Self Esteem</br>
	Bereavement, loss, and other life transitions</br>
	Parenting
	<h2> How We Can Work Together </h2>
	We will establish a non-judgmental relationship that we can utilize to address conflicts and difficult emotions that arise in life and in treatment.  Our alliance can be thought of as a structure through which you become increasingly able to understand your innermost self.  Therapeutic change is achieved in several ways including:
	<ul>
		<li>Feeling you are not alone</li>
		<li>Viewing yourself and others from a new perspective</li>
		<li>Understanding why you are stuck</li>
		<li>Feeling understood</li>
		<li>Becoming less hard on yourself</li>
		<li>Resolving conflicts</li>
	</ul>"}])
